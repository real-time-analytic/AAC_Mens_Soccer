# Assessing Men's Soccer Team Performance in the 2023 American Athletic Conference


This app was created with the intention of providing valuable insights to the UNC Charlotte Men's Soccer Coach with performance metrics on teams within the American Athletic Conference during the 2023 season. This app visually displays the strengths and weaknesses of teams by showing five zones around a goal where a particular team is scoring or being scored on most. To differentiate between zones that have more goals, a heatmap was utilized on top of a soccer field. For visual purposes, the five zones can be seen below.
