# Assessing Men's Soccer Team Performance in the 2023 American Athletic Conference


This app was created with the intention of providing valuable insights to the UNC Charlotte Men's Head Soccer Coach with performance metrics on other teams within the American Athletic Conference during the 2023 season. The app visually displays the strengths and weaknesses of teams within the American Atheltic Conference by showing zones on a soccer field where a particular team is scoring or being scored on most. To differentiate between zones that score more, a crimson color gradient was implemented to display more goals the darker the crimson is for that particular zone. If crimson is not present for one of the five zones, goals were not scored in that particular location. 


# Streamlit app guide


To start, choose a team.

The streamlit app has three tabs; offensive analysis, defensive analysis, match analysis

**Offensive analysis:** displays the location where chosen team has scored all goals during 2023 season
**Defensive analysis:** displays the location of all goals where chosen team has been scored on during 2023 season 
**Match analysis:** choose an opponent and the heatmap displays individual matches where goals were scored for and against each team
